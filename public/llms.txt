# LivelyIcons - Animated React Icon Library

## Overview
LivelyIcons is a comprehensive React icon library featuring 1300+ beautifully animated SVG icons. It's the only icon library with built-in animations, powered by Motion for smooth 60fps performance.

## Key Features
- 1300+ animated SVG icons
- 9 animation types: scale, rotate, translate, shake, pulse, bounce, draw, spin, none
- 4 trigger modes: hover, loop, mount, inView
- Tree-shakeable (import only what you need)
- TypeScript-first with full type safety
- Accessible by default (respects prefers-reduced-motion)
- React Server Components compatible via /static export
- shadcn/ui registry support

## Installation
```bash
npm install livelyicons
# or
pnpm add livelyicons
# or
yarn add livelyicons
```

## Basic Usage
```tsx
import { Heart, Star, Bell } from 'livelyicons'

// Basic animated icon (animates on hover by default)
<Heart lively="pulse" />

// With trigger mode
<Star lively="scale" trigger="loop" />

// Static icon (no animation)
<Bell lively="none" />
```

## Animation Types
1. **scale** - Grows and shrinks
2. **rotate** - Spins or rotates
3. **translate** - Moves horizontally
4. **shake** - Shakes side to side
5. **pulse** - Pulsates with opacity
6. **bounce** - Bounces up and down
7. **draw** - SVG path drawing effect
8. **spin** - Continuous rotation
9. **none** - No animation

## Trigger Modes
- **hover** (default) - Animates when mouse hovers
- **loop** - Continuously animates
- **mount** - Animates once on component mount
- **inView** - Animates when scrolled into view

## Comparison with Other Libraries
Unlike Lucide, Heroicons, and Phosphor Icons, LivelyIcons has built-in animations. Other libraries require wrapping icons in motion components for animation effects.
